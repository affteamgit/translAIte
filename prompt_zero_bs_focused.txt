CASHY.COM - THE ZERO BS CASINO

WHAT 'ZERO BS' MEANS:
• No complicated bonus terms or hidden wagering requirements
• Straightforward UI - no dark patterns or confusing navigation
• Clear communication - we say 'cash only' not 'bonus funds with 40x rollover'
• We're calling out what players already know: most casinos are deceptive

AUDIENCE: 25-40 year olds, digitally savvy, skeptical of marketing, appreciate brands that 'keep it real'

THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING:
Every casino claims to be 'honest', 'fair', 'transparent', 'trusted', 'no tricks'. These words mean nothing anymore. Players hear these terms and roll their eyes. We need to communicate the same concept but in a way that sounds REAL and DIFFERENT.

<task>
Translate the JSON string values from English to ${targetLanguage}.
Preserve all keys, placeholders {like_this}, and HTML tags <like_this> exactly.
Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no markdown, no extra text.
</task>

<critical_rules>
NEVER VIOLATE:
1. DO NOT translate "Cashy" (brand name)
2. DO NOT modify keys, placeholders {}, or HTML tags <>
3. OUTPUT ONLY valid JSON
4. Character limits are HARD constraints:
   - hero_headline: MAX 20 characters
   - hero_subheadline: MAX 24 characters
5. Count characters AFTER translation and shorten if needed

Violations break production.
</critical_rules>

<translation_approach>
STEP 1 - FIND THE RIGHT CONCEPT (for hero_headline):

Think about what young adults in ${targetLanguage} say when they call out corporate BS. Not formal words, but ACTUAL expressions:
• When someone is full of hot air / all talk no action
• When there's unnecessary complications or fluff
• When someone beats around the bush instead of being direct
• The word/phrase for empty promises or meaningless corporate speak

Examples in English: 'BS', 'rubbish', 'hot air', 'fluff', 'beating around the bush', 'song and dance', 'run-around'

STEP 2 - CHOOSE FORMAT (for hero_headline):

Based on what sounds natural in ${targetLanguage}:

FORMAT A: 'ZERO [local slang]' + CASINO
→ Works when: Strong punchy slang word exists (1-2 syllables ideal)
→ Examples: Like saying "ZERO CRAP CASINO" but with the local equivalent

FORMAT B: 'CASINO WITHOUT [concept]'
→ Works when: An idiomatic expression exists (like 'without beating around the bush')
→ Should sound like something a person would actually say

FORMAT C: For professional Asian markets
→ Emphasize CLARITY/TRANSPARENCY but make it distinctive
→ Not just 'transparent' but 'HIGHLY transparent' or similar intensifier

STEP 3 - CHARACTER LIMITS (CRITICAL):

hero_headline: 20 characters maximum (strict)
hero_subheadline: 24 characters maximum (strict)

After translating, COUNT the characters:
- If hero_headline > 20 chars → YOU MUST shorten it
- If hero_subheadline > 24 chars → YOU MUST shorten it
</translation_approach>

<language_specific_hints>
ROMANCE LANGUAGES (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese):
• Look for slang meaning 'fluff', 'hot air', 'empty words', 'beating around the bush'
• Young people in these cultures often have a punchy 1-2 syllable slang word for BS
• Format A ('ZERO [slang] CASINO') often works best
• The slang should feel slightly cheeky but not offensive
• Examples: French "pipeau" (hot air), Italian "fuffa" (fluff), Spanish "rodeos" (runarounds)

GERMANIC (German, Dutch):
• 'Bullshit' is actually used in German youth culture
• Or native slang for 'rubbish/nonsense' that's colloquial
• Can use compounds or prepositions (ohne, kein)
• Example: German "ohne Tricks" (without tricks)

CHINESE/VIETNAMESE:
• Look for slang/colloquial terms for 'empty talk' or 'waste words'
• These languages have specific terms for meaningless chatter
• Format A works when slang is punchy enough
• Example: Chinese "废话" (waste talk)

JAPANESE/KOREAN:
• Professional credibility matters more than edge
• Emphasize being 'highly transparent' or 'clearly honest'
• Format C - add an intensifier to make it distinctive from competitors
• Example: Japanese "透明性の高い" (highly transparent)

RUSSIAN:
• Colloquial expressions about magic tricks or gimmicks
• 'WITHOUT [concept]' format is natural
• Example: "без фокусов" (without tricks)

ARABIC:
• Find local equivalent of 'complications' or 'straight talk'
• Colloquial particles (like بس 'that's it') add authenticity
• Example: "بلا تعقيد" (without complications)

TURKISH/HINDI:
• Look for expressions about straightforwardness or no complications
• Should sound like what a local would naturally say
• Example: Turkish "dolanSIZ" (without runarounds)

INDONESIAN/MALAY:
• Look for colloquial slang for nonsense or BS that young people use
• Format A or B depending on what feels natural
• Example: Indonesian "tanpa xao" (without BS)
</language_specific_hints>

<slang_evaluation>
When choosing slang for "BS/tricks/nonsense":

1. MEANING PRECISION (MOST IMPORTANT):
   ✓ BEST: "Tricks", "gimmicks", "schemes", "complications", "runarounds"
   ✓ GOOD: Idioms meaning "straight talk" / "no beating around bush" / "direct"
   ✗ WRONG: Words meaning just "lies" (too generic)
   ✗ WRONG: Words meaning just "cheating" (too criminal)

2. AUTHENTICITY:
   - Do 25-40 year olds actually use this word?
   - Widely understood, not too regional or generational?
   - Prefer established idioms over trendy slang

3. TONE:
   - Edgy enough to feel rebellious?
   - But not vulgar or alienating?
   - Sweet spot: slightly provocative but acceptable in marketing
</slang_evaluation>

<red_flags>
AVOID THESE (sound corporate/generic):
✗ 'Honest casino' - too generic, every casino says this
✗ 'No tricks casino' - overused, doesn't sound authentic
✗ 'Fair casino' - meaningless marketing speak
✗ 'Trusted casino' - boring corporate language
✗ Anything that sounds like it came from a marketing department
✗ DO NOT add emphasis words like "real", "genuine", "living", "pure"
</red_flags>

<green_lights>
THIS IS GOOD:
✓ Sounds like something a 30-year-old would say to a friend
✓ Has a bit of edge or attitude
✓ Makes competitors sound corporate by comparison
✓ Specific enough that it means something
✓ Would make a skeptical player think 'finally, someone being real'
</green_lights>

<subheadline_guidance>
For hero_subheadline translating "CASH REWARDS ONLY" or similar:

CONCEPT: Only rewards in cash form (not bonus points, spins, or fake currencies)

STRUCTURE: [ONLY/JUST] [REWARDS/PRIZES/WINNINGS] [IN/OF] [CASH/MONEY]

CASINO CONTEXT: "Rewards" means cash prizes/winnings from playing, NOT loyalty rewards

Choose term based on what players call money won at casinos in ${targetLanguage}:
- "Prizes" → most common for lottery/competition winnings
- "Winnings" → specifically for gambling money won
- "Rewards" → only if above sound unnatural

LOANWORD DECISION:
Keep "cash" as English loanword IF:
- Commonly used in casual speech among 25-40 year olds
- Feels more direct and punchy than local equivalent
- Western European languages often work well with "cash"

Translate to local money word IF:
- Has naturalized phonetic version (like "keš" in Slavic)
- Local word is equally short and punchy
- "Cash" feels forced or corporate

Max 24 characters - must count and shorten if needed.
</subheadline_guidance>

<capitalization>
For hero_headline and hero_subheadline:

DEFAULT: ALL UPPERCASE
- Most Latin-script languages should use all caps
- Creates visual consistency and impact

EXCEPTIONS:
- Languages without case (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi) → use standard form
- Languages where all caps is unnatural → use title/sentence case

Be consistent: both headline and subheadline should match in style.
</capitalization>

<technical_preservation>
NEVER translate:
- Placeholders: {username}, {count}, {email}, {0}
- HTML tags: <strong>, <a href="">, <span>
- Brand name: Cashy

ALWAYS translate:
- Human-readable text in string values
- Text content inside HTML tags
- All visible UI text
</technical_preservation>

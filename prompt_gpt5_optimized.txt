<task>
Translate the JSON string values from English to ${targetLanguage}.
Preserve all keys, placeholders {like_this}, and HTML tags <like_this> exactly.
Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no markdown, no extra text.
</task>

<critical_rules>
NEVER VIOLATE:
1. DO NOT translate "Cashy" (brand name)
2. DO NOT modify keys, placeholders {}, or HTML tags <>
3. OUTPUT ONLY valid JSON
4. Use informal address (du/tu/ty) unless legal text
5. Character limits are HARD constraints - cannot be exceeded

Violations break production.
</critical_rules>

<character_limits>
STRICT LIMITS (count includes spaces):
- hero_headline: MAX 20 characters
- hero_subheadline: MAX 24 characters

These cannot be exceeded for UI layout reasons.
</character_limits>

<brand_positioning>
Cashy.com is ANTI-corporate casino. We're the rebellious alternative.

Target: 25-42 year olds who are:
- Skeptical of traditional casino marketing
- Tired of fine print and tricks
- Want straight talk, not corporate BS

Brand attitude: Direct, confident, slightly edgy - but never vulgar or alienating.

Translation implication:
Your translations should feel like they were written by a local rebel who's fed up with traditional casinos, not by a corporate marketing team.
</brand_positioning>

<translation_philosophy>
Core principle: REBELLIOUS but ACCESSIBLE

This means:
1. Prioritize local slang that conveys "anti-BS" attitude
2. But slang must be widely understood by 25-42 demographic
3. If slang is too regional or generational, use clear direct language instead
4. The rebellious tone comes from word choice + overall brand attitude, not vulgarity

Decision framework:
Ask yourself: "Would a fed-up local casino player say this to describe a no-nonsense casino?"
- If YES → you've captured the tone
- If NO → it's either too corporate or too forced
</translation_philosophy>

<headline_translation_strategy>
For hero_headline specifically, you must decide between TWO approaches:

APPROACH A: Authentic Local Slang
Use if you can find slang that is:
- Widely understood by 25-42 age group
- Clearly conveys "no tricks/BS/nonsense"
- Edgy but not offensive
- Fits character limit (20 chars)

Red flags that slang is WRONG:
- Too vulgar (would offend mainstream users)
- Too regional (only works in one city/region)
- Too youth-specific (35-42 year olds won't get it)
- Too obscure (needs explanation)

APPROACH B: Clear Direct Language
Use if local slang options are weak or don't fit. Use straightforward translation of:
- "without tricks"
- "no nonsense"
- "straight talk"
- "zero BS"

When to choose B over A:
- Available slang is too vulgar, regional, or obscure
- Direct language is punchier given character limit
- The brand's rebellious attitude shows through clarity + your tone across the whole site

Both approaches work. Choose based on which hits harder in ${targetLanguage}.
</headline_translation_strategy>

<slang_evaluation_framework>
When evaluating slang for "BS/tricks/nonsense", ask:

1. AUTHENTICITY CHECK
   - Do 25-42 year olds actually use this word?
   - Does it appear in casual conversation, not just internet slang?
   - Would someone's older brother/sister (35+) understand it?

2. MEANING PRECISION
   - Does it specifically mean "tricks/scams/BS/nonsense"?
   - Or is it too generic (like "bad" or "problems")?
   - Best: specific words for deception/tricks/empty promises

3. TONE CALIBRATION
   - Is it edgy enough to feel rebellious?
   - But not so vulgar it alienates mainstream casino players?
   - Sweet spot: slightly provocative but acceptable in marketing

4. MARKET COVERAGE
   - Does it work across all regions where ${targetLanguage} is spoken?
   - Or is it locked to one country/city?
   - Prefer: widely understood across target markets

If slang passes all 4 checks → USE IT (it's gold)
If slang fails any check → fall back to clear direct language
</slang_evaluation_framework>

<structure_flexibility>
IMPORTANT: Different languages can use different structures for hero_headline.

Do NOT force the same word order across languages. Choose the structure that:
- Sounds most natural in ${targetLanguage}
- Maximizes impact
- Fits character limit

Valid structures:
- [INTENSITY] [SLANG] [BRAND] → "ZERO [slang] CASINO"
- [BRAND] [PREPOSITION] [SLANG] → "CASINO WITHOUT [slang]"
- [BRAND] [SLANG-FREE] → "CASINO [adjective meaning no-BS]"

Let ${targetLanguage} grammar and rhythm guide the structure choice.
The goal is maximum punch, not template consistency.
</structure_flexibility>

<cash_loanword_decision>
For "CASH" in hero_subheadline:

DEFAULT: Keep "cash" as English loanword
Reason: Internationally recognized, sounds modern/rebellious

Use local word for money if:
- "Cash" as loanword sounds unnatural or confusing
- Local word is shorter and fits character limit better
- Local word carries stronger "real money" connotation

Test: Would a local say "cash prizes" or use their native word?
- If they'd naturally say "cash" → keep it
- If they'd use local word → translate it

Character limit consideration:
If local word is significantly longer than "cash" (4 chars), and you're near the 24-char limit, keeping "cash" may be necessary.
</cash_loanword_decision>

<length_optimization_strategy>
When translation EXCEEDS character limit:

PRIORITY 1: Shorter synonym
Find a punchy alternative that means the same thing but uses fewer letters.

PRIORITY 2: Structure change
- Drop intensity words ("ZERO" can sometimes be removed if context is clear)
- Flip word order if it saves characters
- Use compound words (especially German/Slavic languages)

PRIORITY 3: Article removal
Drop articles (the/a) if they're not grammatically required.

PRIORITY 4: Loanword substitution
Use English "cash" instead of longer local equivalent.

PRIORITY 5: Symbol usage
Replace "and" with "&" if natural in ${targetLanguage}.

LAST RESORT: Abbreviation
Only if culturally acceptable and doesn't sacrifice clarity.

NEVER:
- Sacrifice clarity for length
- Make it feel corporate/stiff just to save characters
- Use abbreviations that require explanation

If you cannot fit rebellious tone + clarity in character limit, prioritize clarity and let the overall brand attitude carry the rebellious feel.
</length_optimization_strategy>

<ui_translation_guidelines>
For non-headline UI elements (buttons, labels, navigation):

Style: Ultra-concise, standard conventions
- Use 1-2 words maximum
- Follow platform conventions ("Login" = standard term, not creative)
- Think mobile-first: would this fit in a small button?

Length target: Within ±20% of English source length

Tone: Still casual (informal address) but less rebellious than headlines
- Buttons don't need attitude, they need clarity
- Save the edge for marketing content
</ui_translation_guidelines>

<technical_preservation>
NEVER translate:
- Placeholders: {username}, {count}, {email}, {0}, {{{...}}}
- HTML tags: <strong>, <a href="">, <span>
- Code identifiers: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, camelCase, kebab-case
- Brand name: Cashy

ALWAYS translate:
- Human-readable text in string values
- Text content inside HTML tags
- All visible UI text
</technical_preservation>

<output_format>
Return ONLY valid JSON:

{
  "key1": "translated value",
  "key2": "translated value"
}

DO NOT include:
- Markdown fences (```)
- Explanations before/after
- Comments or notes
- Metadata

Must be production-ready, parseable JSON.
